The timber viaduct was opened on 21st June 1859 when the line completed to Tavistock. Stations were provided at Bickleigh, Horrabridge and Tavistock, all of which opened to traffic on June 22nd 1859. The line closed to passengers in 1962 and goods 1964. After the scrapmen cleared the line it lay quietly decaying until the coming of the cycle route.",
